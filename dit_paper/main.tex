\begin{abstract}
Blockchain technologies have manifested the paradigm of decentralized computation. The power of peers allows for fully trustless computation overcoming the necessity for a central, error-prone entity.  
%
Since then Blockchain technologies have found a great number of applications, ranging from financial transactions to Web3 services. However, it has not yet been researched whether and which problems in Software Engineering (SE) Blockchain technology could solve. 

In this paper, we coin the notion Decentralized Software Engineering (DSE) and exemplify how Blockchain technology could solve three core SE problems: Validation of the software requirements (analysis), the design and architecture, and the implementation (testing).
%
We believe that Blockchain technology could help (1) democratize, incentivize and professionalize Software Engineering that currently relies on free work done by few volunteers, (2) improve the quality of software solutions, and (3) increase trust and fault-tolerance in ubiquitously used systems.
 

In this paper we present dit, a dApp for software development that overcomes some of the intrinsic problems with coding (...).
