\begin{abstract}
Blockchain technologies introduced the new paradigm of decentralized computation. It is the power of the peers that allows for fully trustless computation overcoming the need for a central, error-prone authority. Recently, the power of decentralization carried over to the people. The notion of DAOs asks the people instead of computing nodes to agree on the next step of an organization, a project or a decision, this way rendering the need for a centralized decision maker void as well.

In this paper we introduce the concept of decentralized software development leveraging the blockchain. We present dit, a dApp for decentralized software development that overcomes some of the intrinsic problems with coding.
