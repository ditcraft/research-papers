Reaching private Consensus with Wisdom against Wealth}

\begin{abstract}
Consensus protocols allow a set of peers to agree on a common state. A subset of the family of consensus protocols are votings. They reach an agreement with additional privacy guarantees to protect voters against any form of post-voting threat. The one-person-one-vote (1p1v) with the majority function is the preferred mechanism in many countries to implement democratic choice.

In a permissionless blockchain network implementing 1p1v democratic choice is impossible.
Prior voting schemes in this setting relied on staking as an intrinsic cryptoeconomic mechanism to incentivize honest democratic decisions, but have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks where oligarchs bias the outcome. 

We present a radically new voting scheme in the permissionless blockchain model. Our protocol is based on knowledge instead of wealth.
